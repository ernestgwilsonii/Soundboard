# General Code Style Principles

This document outlines general coding principles that apply across all languages and frameworks used in this project.

## Readability (The Soundboard Priority)
- **Code is for Humans:** Always prioritize human understanding over machine efficiency or code brevity.
- **Semantic Naming:** Choose names that reveal intent. A developer should understand what a variable holds or a function does without reading its implementation.
- **No Magic Values:** Abstract all strings and numbers into Constants or Enums.

## Single Responsibility
- Each module, class, and function should have one reason to change.
- Prefer many small, well-named functions over few large ones.

## Consistency
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase.
- Maintain consistent formatting, naming, and structure.

## Simplicity
- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones.
- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

## Maintainability
- Write code that is easy to modify and extend.
- Minimize dependencies and coupling.

## Documentation
- Document *why* something is done, not just *what*.
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.
